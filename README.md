# Ad-Network

## Introduction
Everyone needs to be adverstised ,But the real problem is where to place your ads to get immense exposure, which in turns improve the selling point of your product. Most of the advetisers have this dilemma. Also most of the app developers are willing to provide advertising spaces who are not paid well. So we just link these two groups into a single network "Ad-Network".

## How it works?

Our beta version targets only in android apps, So the system is much simpler as you can imagine.
   >  *  Just login to our ad-network.
   >  *  Create an account.
   >  *  Select your role (Advertiser or Provider).
   >  *  Place your ad or Select your ad
   
## How you get paid on Ad-Network?

This is based on the number of ad plays ie the time you allocate for a particular ad.
>  ####  For an advetiser
>        The advertiser have to buy certain Ad-Network packages inorder to advertise.
>        Packages include the number of plays,type of advertisements,type of applications e.t.c
>  ####  For a advertisement provider (App Developer)
>        The provider (the one who shows the ad in their app, most probably the app developers) needs to set up their profile for the type of advertisement requirement.
>
