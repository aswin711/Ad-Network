# Ad-Network

## Introduction
Everyone needs to be adverstised ,But the real problem is where to place your ads to get immense exposure, which in turns improve the selling point of your product. Most of the advetisers have this dilemma. Also most of the app developers are willing to provide advertising spaces who are not paid well. So we just link these two groups into a single network "Ad-Network".

## How it works?

Our beta version targets only in android apps, So the system is much simpler as you can imagine.
   >  *  Just login to ad-network.
   >  *  Create an account.
   >  *  Select your role (Advertiser or Provider).
   >  *  Place your ad or Select your ad
   
## How you get paid on Ad-Network?

This is based on the number of ad plays ie the time you allocate for a particular ad.
>  ####  For an advetiser
>        The advertiser have to buy certain Ad-Network packages inorder to advertise.
>        Packages include the number of plays,type of advertisements,type of applications e.t.c
>  ####  For an advertisement provider (App Developer)
>        The provider (the one who shows the ad in their app, most probably the app
>        developers) needs to set up their profile for the type of advertisement requirement.

  #### Revenue Model
  
  The revenue model invloves revenue generation on the basis of advertisements playing duration.
  
  *  For example,
      Consider the condition for a advertiser,need to advertise in through Ad-Network. How they want to pay us?
      
      Total payment can be part of package or duration based.
      
      If it is duration based:
            
            Total amount = Total duration in sec * Rate (based on type)
            
    
  * Now consider the situation for an app developer
  
       They shall be paid on the basis of the advertisement they are chosen, type of advertisement boxes and categories.
       
       
       Here also we follow the same equation:
       
            Total amount = Total duration in sec * Rate (based on type)
            
            
## Type of Advertisement

  The advertisement can be of various categories which includes Products,Health Care,Services,Automobiles e.t.c
  
  For App Developers, we provide the above mentioned category along with the selection of  advertisement boxes.
  
  ### What is an advertisement box?
 
 It is ui based.App developer can allot a space on app screen for the advertisement.
 It can be of three types:
 
 * Full Screen Ad
 * Bottom Gravity Ad
 * RecyclerView Ad
